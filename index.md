This book has two purposes. First, it describes a broad class of mathematical system models, called stochastic processing networks (SPNs), that are useful as representations of service systems, industrial processes, and digital systems for computing and com-munication. And second, it develops a fluid model methodology for proving SPN stability, by which we mean proving positive recurrence of the Markov chain describing the SPN.
